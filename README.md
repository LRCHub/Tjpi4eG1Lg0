[00:01.08] Chasing down our happiness
[00:05.08] But all we do is make a mess
[00:08.72] I'd rather bear the loneliness
[00:12.13] Than to suffer in silence with you
[00:29.13] 
[00:15.52] We're always trying, never realizing
[00:18.91] This fire we're fighting is burning us up
[00:23.09] Yeah, we're surviving, but we're still dying
[00:26.41] No more denying, it's time to give up
[00:44.91] 
[00:29.73] 'Cause not even love can save us from us
[00:37.47] Not even love can bring back the way it was
[00:44.55] No, not even love, not even love
[00:52.12] Not even love can save us from us
[01:08.62] 
[00:59.52] Not even love
[01:06.58] No, not even love can save us from us
[01:14.29] No, not even love, not even love
[01:21.50] No, not even love, not even love
[01:37.50] 
[01:44.13] We're always trying, never realizing
[01:47.56] This fire we're fighting is burning us up
[01:51.56] Yeah, we're surviving, but we're still dying
[01:55.19] No more denying, it's time to give up
[02:13.69] 
[01:58.62] 'Cause not even love can save us from us
[02:06.18] Not even love can bring back the way it was
[02:13.28] No, not even love, not even love
[02:20.67] Not even love can save us from us
[02:37.17] 
[02:57.63] Not even love
[03:05.13] No, not even love can bring back the way it was
[03:12.54] No, not even love
[03:19.67] Not even love
[03:27.25] Not even love, not even love
[03:34.59] No, not even love, not even love
[03:50.59] 
[03:41.88] No, not even love, not even love
[03:49.33] No, not even love, not even love
